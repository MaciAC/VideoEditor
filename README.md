# VideoEditor

Project to develop a "realtime multitake video editor". Based on the [MultiCam entity](https://support.apple.com/guide/final-cut-pro/ver23c764f1/mac) from Apple's Final Cut Pro X video editor, I liked the software after trying the free version but the license expired and I didn't want to pay.
